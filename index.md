# Agentic-AKM

Agentic-AKM (Agentic Architecture Knowledge Management) is an independent research initiative that investigates how humans and software agents can co-design, build, and evolve complex software systems by managing architectural knowledge as a living, revisable system. The focus is on knowledge management as an ongoing practice rather than a static model, with attention to how architectural intent, constraints, and rationale are created, contested, and maintained over time.

This is a self-directed research effort with no institutional affiliation.

## Goals

- Define a standard structure so humans and agents can collaborate on software development.
- Establish an agent-agnostic contextual base that enforces sound engineering and architecture practices.
- Create a tool that integrates with new projects—enabling an agent to elicit vision, mission, architecture, and core artifacts—and with existing projects by extracting context from current sources and documentation.

## Status

Active construction. Materials are intentionally concise and subject to change as the research matures, and associated tooling is published early to invite feedback and scrutiny.
